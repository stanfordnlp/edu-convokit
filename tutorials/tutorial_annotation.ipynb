Some of the annotations we'll cover include:\n","- <a href=\"#📝-annotating-talk-time\">Section Link 🔗</a> Talk Time: We will annotate the amount of time the student and educator talk.\n","- <a href=\"#📝-annotating-student-reasoning\">Section Link 🔗</a> Student Reasoning: We will annotate use of reasoning in the student's speech.\n","- <a href=\"#📝-annotating-teacher-focusing-questions\">Section Link 🔗</a> Teacher Focusing Questions: We will annotate the use of focusing questions by the educator.\n","- <a href=\"#📝-annotating-conversational-uptake\">Section Link 🔗</a> Conversational Uptake: We will annotate instances of high conversational uptake by the educator.\n","\n","For other annotations, please refer to the [documentation](https://edu-convokit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.\n","If you want to add your own annotations, please make a pull request to the [repo](https://github.com/rosewang2008/edu-convokit/).\n","\n","Without further ado, let's get started!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3F8CtV9cQul9"},"source":["##
